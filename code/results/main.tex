	\maketitle
	
	The results have been created with four different classes of functions, one for each Table. They can be found in the main folder together with the \texttt{main.py} file. Note that I have used a couple of libraries whose installation may be needed. Everything is specificated both in the \texttt{main.py} and in the \href{https://github.com/r-uben/hw}{GitHub} repository. However, simple errors would appear in the console if there's a library missing, so it should not be difficult to notice that.
	
	Further, in order to preserve the fancy style of this document, I have created two subfolders with the \texttt{.txt} created for each table: one of them will be updated each time the code runs. The other one is fixed (\texttt{subtables\_fixed}).
