Here we are considering
$$
\begin{aligned}
	M_t 	&= \bar{M}_{t-1} - bF_t\\
	R_t^j 	&= \bar{r}_{t-1} + \beta_{t-1} F_t
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\E_t[F_{t+1}] = 0$ and $\sigma_t[F_{t+1}] = \bar{\sigma}_t^2$, $\forall  t$. Note that variance dependes on time. In this case, NA gives us
$$
	\E_t[R_{t+1}^j - R_t^f] = b\beta^j\sigma_t^2.
$$
If I can express a conditional model through an un conditional model, that's good news.

Note that therefore you can recover $\beta_1$ by simply doing an OLS regression. The problem is that you have an omitted variable, the time-varying expected return. If we have monthly (or high-frequency data), they can be taken as constant...
