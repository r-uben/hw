Let's assume NA \& complete (interior) markets. Hence,
$$
	S_t \text{MU}_t^\text{\euro} = MU_t^\$,
$$
for all times and all states. Hence,
$$
	\frac{S_t}{S_{t-1}}\times \frac{MU_{t}^{\text{\euro}}}{MU_{t-1}^{\text{\euro}}} =  \frac{MU_{t}^{\$}}{MU_{t-1}^{\$}}.
$$
Hence,
$$
	\frac{S_t}{S_{t-1}} SDF_t^\text{\euro}\pi_{t|t-1} = SDF_{t}^\$\pi_{t|t-1}.
$$
Hence, in log units,
$$
	\Delta s_t = m_t^{\$} - m_t^\text{\euro}	.
$$
From now on we are going do denot ``Home'' by $H$ and ``Foreign'' by $F$. Hence
$$
	\begin{aligned}
		m_t^H &= b^H \cdot F_t\\
		m_t^F &= b^F \cdot F_t.
	\end{aligned}
$$
Hence,
$$
	\Delta s = (b^H - b^F) F_t.
$$	
Think of $\Delta s$ as the currency return. Then, you immediately figure out that 
$$
	\beta^{\textsc{fx}} = b^H - b^F.		
$$
Under NA, currency excess return must be a result of heterogeneity among countries (otherwise the beta would be zero, and no other excess returns would be possible).

In order to have a non zero contribution to the risk premium, we need to things: 1. non zero $\beta$ (heterogeneous loadings); 2. The factors $F$ are not country-specific.
In otder to prove the second thing, i.e., that factors are global, note that
$$
	\text{RP}^{\textsc{fx}} = - \cov_t(m_{t+1}^H, \Delta s_{t+1}) = b^H(b^H-b^F)\V(F).
$$
